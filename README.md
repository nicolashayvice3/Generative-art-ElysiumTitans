Generative art script in Javascript.

The following code is a script that overlaps certain art variable art pieces to create a final piece based on the construct of the additions. The main use for this work was an NFT project called Elysium Titans, nevertheless it is available for anyone that wants to make generative art.

I have transalated the script from GO (golang), the original piece was made by https://github.com/naeri-kailash.
